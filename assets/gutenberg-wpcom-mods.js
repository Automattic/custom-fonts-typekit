/**
 * Re-activates the Facebook and Instagram embed block variations by
 * making them appear in the inserter and their URL patterns parseable again.
 *
 * Relevant for Gutenberg >= 9.0, where the aforementioned blocks were deprecated*[0] because
 * they do not support the oEmbed changes that Facebook is going to implement on Oct. 24th, 2020,
 * and core has currently no plans to support it.
 *
 * However, we do plan on keeping support for them on WPCOM/AT. Facebook is adding a token
 * authentication mechanism to its new oEmbed implementation, and we are following suit.
 * We're counting on this*[1] to result in something that continues to render the embeds
 * on the backend, using an authenticated mechanism, as required by Facebook's new policy.
 *
 * Our goal is for this go unnoticed by our end-users, as this is only an implementation detail.
 *
 * For now, we're patching them so they continue to work as before, as the current FB oEmbed implementation is still
 * active.
 *

 * @param {string} name The block name
 * @return {Object} The settings for the given block with the patched variations.
